# @fantasticfour/world-mysql-redis

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- ee02f27: Rewrite the Redis delay queue for durability and align the package with the
  @workflow/world 4.2.1 contract.

  The queue is rebuilt around a delayed sorted set with atomic Lua promotion,
  per-message leases with orphan reclaim, and a dead-letter queue that releases
  the idempotency key on exhaustion so core's replay self-heals the run. The
  inert transactional outbox is removed: storage and queue are invoked
  independently by the contract so no shared transaction ever existed for a true
  outbox, and the durable queue now provides the actual guarantee. Migrations
  0002-0005 ship with this release, covering `events.occurred_at`, the outbox
  table drop, `cancelled` in the `steps.status` enum, and a per-run index on
  `stream_chunks`.

  `specVersion` is transported with a binary-safe encoding so it survives round
  trips through MySQL string columns. The typed error taxonomy now matches the
  names `@workflow/core` checks by name, `hook_created` conflict semantics match
  upstream (race loser routes through the conflict path rather than throwing), and
  dense per-stream sequences use `FOR UPDATE` to eliminate phantom gaps. A
  pre-allocation bug that caused the synthetic `run_created` event to sort after
  `run_started` is fixed by porting upstream's lazy `eventId` allocation.

  Note: the CLI migration runner is one-shot and has no tracking table, so
  existing databases must apply migrations 0002-0005 manually. See `cli.ts` for
  the documented procedure.

### Patch Changes

- 1b8fae6: Bundle `@fantasticfour/shared` into the published output instead of importing it
  at runtime.

  `@fantasticfour/shared` is a private, unpublished workspace package, but
  `world-mysql-redis` listed it under `dependencies`, so tsdown left it external
  and the published bundle (and its `.d.ts`) imported a package that does not
  exist on npm, breaking `npm install`. Moving it to `devDependencies` (matching
  every other world) lets tsdown inline it, producing a self-contained artifact.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- c4b795f: Slim down world packages by switching to an HTTP-callback architecture (matching our own
  `@fantasticfour/world-upstash`).

  **Dependency drops (runtime):**

  - `@workflow/world-local` removed from every world package.
  - `@vercel/queue` removed from `world-redis`, `world-redis-bullmq`,
    `world-postgres-redis`, `world-mysql-redis`, `world-nats-jetstream`.
  - `zod` removed from `world-redis`, `world-redis-bullmq`,
    `world-postgres-redis`, `world-mysql`, `world-mysql-redis`,
    `world-nats-jetstream` (replaced with hand-rolled validation for the two
    trivial schemas that used it; dead `Base64Buffer` codec deleted from
    `world-redis`).

  **Architectural change:**

  Workers no longer execute workflows in-process via `@workflow/world-local`.
  Instead, each world dispatches jobs over HTTP to the user's app server at
  `${baseUrl}/.well-known/workflow/v1/{flow|step}`, the same convention used by
  the Workflow DevKit. Three header fields carry the envelope:

  - `x-vqs-queue-name`
  - `x-vqs-message-id`
  - `x-vqs-message-attempt`

  A 503 response with `{ "timeoutSeconds": number }` is treated as a soft retry
  (does not consume an attempt). Other non-2xx responses trigger exponential
  backoff up to `maxAttempts`.

  For the cloud-managed worlds (`world-azure`, `world-cloudflare`,
  `world-firestore-tasks`), production paths are unchanged (Service Bus,
  Cloudflare Queues, Cloud Tasks with their native delivery wire formats). In
  test mode, each now ships a small in-process test pump that HTTP-dispatches
  back to the user's server using the same `x-vqs-*` headers as the other
  worlds, so test behaviour is consistent across the whole repo.

  **Breaking change for `start()` consumers:**

  If you call `world.start()` and previously relied on the embedded
  `@workflow/world-local` to execute workflows in-process, you now need a
  reachable HTTP server hosting `world.createQueueHandler(...)` at the standard
  routes. The `@workflow/world-testing` harness already does this, and any app
  following the Workflow DevKit convention is already compatible.

  New config knobs on each world (all optional):

  - `baseUrl`: overrides `process.env.WORKFLOW_BASE_URL` /
    `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}`
  - `httpTimeoutMs`: per-job request timeout (default 300_000)
  - `maxAttempts` / `backoffDelayMs` / `backoffType` where applicable

  **Why:**

  Most packages were shipping 8-11 runtime deps. Dropping the three deps above
  trims every world to a leaner footprint. Build outputs are smaller, install
  trees lighter, and the in-repo `world-upstash` precedent (already on this
  architecture) made the target shape obvious.

## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- 66826e7: Bump tsdown to ^0.22.0 so the bundler resolves rolldown@1.0.0 (stable v1)
  instead of the prior 1.0.0-rc.17. tsdown 0.22 drops Node < 22.18 support,
  makes `unrun` optional, and adds a `tsx` config loader; CI already runs
  Node 24, which uses the native TS config loader and needs neither.
  No consumer-facing API change.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 59da2b7: Port `events.create` bug fixes and improvements from `@workflow/world-postgres@4.1.1` to all world storage implementations:

  - **run_started idempotency**: When run is already `running`, return existing run without appending a duplicate event
  - **Resilient start**: When `run_started` arrives for a non-existent run with eventData, bootstrap the run + synthetic `run_created` event atomically (recovery from partial start failures)
  - **RunExpiredError**: Throw `RunExpiredError` (not generic error) for `run_started` on terminal runs so the runtime exits without retrying; use `EntityConflictError` for other terminal state transitions
  - **Strip run_started eventData**: `run_started` events no longer store eventData (belongs on `run_created` only)
  - **Step cancelled terminal state**: Add `'cancelled'` to step terminal state checks
  - **Preloaded events (TTFB)**: `run_started` response now includes all events for the run, allowing the runtime to skip the initial `events.list` call

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e2d3f2e: Reliability and observability enhancements across all world packages, plus event-idempotency bug fixes and a new shared utilities package.

  ## New Package

  - `@fantasticfour/shared`: common utilities extracted from world packages: debug logging (`createDebugLogger`), JSON serialization helpers (`stringify`, `parse`, `dateReviver`, `uint8ArrayReplacer`/`uint8ArrayReviver`, `deepClone`), correlation context (`withCorrelation`, `getCorrelationId`, `createCorrelatedLogger`), health-check primitives (`HealthCheckResult`, `ComponentHealth`, `HealthCheckable`, `timeOperation`), `Cborized` type, and small utilities (`compact`, `Mutex`, `Rc`).

  ## Critical Bug Fixes: Event Idempotency

  Event-sourced systems must be idempotent. Replaying creation events (for recovery, debugging, or state reconstruction) was causing entities to disappear from list queries because the "Always-Add Pattern" implementation skipped index updates and returned `undefined` on duplicates.

  Fixed in:

  - `world-redis-bullmq`, `world-upstash`, `world-redis`: SETNX-based handlers for `run_created`, `step_created`, `hook_created` now always update indexes (ZADD is idempotent) and return the existing entity on replay.
  - `world-postgres-redis`: Drizzle `.onConflictDoNothing()` paths now fetch and return the existing row instead of `undefined`.
  - `world-nats-jetstream`: KV-bucket creation handlers now read back the existing entity when the key already exists rather than returning `undefined`.

  Naming: `existed` renamed to `wasCreated` for clarity.

  ## Test Coverage

  All 10 world packages now have idempotency test coverage. New test files added for `world-mysql`, `world-mysql-redis`, `world-azure`, `world-nats-jetstream`, and `world-upstash`. Existing suites in `world-redis-bullmq`, `world-redis`, `world-postgres-redis`, `world-cloudflare`, and `world-firestore-tasks` were expanded with idempotency cases. Tests verify:

  1. Creating an entity twice returns the existing entity (not `undefined`/error)
  2. Duplicate events do not create duplicate entries
  3. Entities always appear in list/index queries after duplicate events

  Test files were also DRYed up (helper simplification, direct `beforeEach` references, inlined schema setup) and storage API call signatures corrected (`.get(id)` rather than `.get({ id })`).

  ## Build

  `tsup.config.ts` added to all world packages for consistent bundling.

  ## Migration

  No breaking API changes. The new `@fantasticfour/shared` package is a workspace dependency consumed internally by the world packages. Outbox/NOTIFY migrations are additive (`0001_outbox.sql`, `0002_outbox_and_notify.sql`) and should be applied via the package's existing migration tooling.

### Patch Changes

- d9dc22d: Migrate bundler from `tsup` to `tsdown` (Rolldown-based) across all world packages. Build is significantly faster and configs are simpler. Public `exports` map and emitted file extensions (`.js`, `.d.ts`) are unchanged. `dotenv` continues to be externalized in CLI bundles. Code-splitting is enabled (Rolldown default), so multi-entry packages now emit shared `chunk-*.js` files alongside existing entry artifacts.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- 2a1587e: Upgrade @workflow packages to stable 4.1.x

  Production dependencies upgraded from beta to stable 4.1.1:

  - @workflow/world: 4.1.0-beta.17 -> 4.1.1
  - @workflow/world-local: 4.1.0-beta.51 -> 4.1.1

  Dev dependency kept on compatible beta version:

  - @workflow/world-testing: 4.1.0-beta.53 (stable has breaking test changes)

  All validation passes: lint, typecheck, and full test suite.
